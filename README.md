## 🔍 Sample Output

1. Optimized Resume Bullet Points (ATS-Friendly)

These bullets replace passive language with "Action Verb + Task + Result/Metric" structures.

2. Missing But Important Skills

To be competitive for a GenAI Intern role, you need to bridge the gap between "using tools" and "building with tools." Add these if you have even basic familiarity, or start learning them immediately:

Prompting Techniques: Explicitly list techniques you know (e.g., Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Few-Shot Prompting, Zero-Shot, RAG basics).

Technical Stack: Instead of "little bit of Python," list: Python (Pandas, NumPy basics) or Python for Scripting.

APIs: Mention OpenAI API or Hugging Face if you have used them to run your scripts.

Version Control: Git/GitHub is essential for any tech intern role.


3. Professional LinkedIn “About” Section

This narrative frames your sales background as an asset for communication, while focusing heavily on your new technical direction.
